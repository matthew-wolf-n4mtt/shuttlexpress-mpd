Shuttlexpress-MPD is a Music Player Daemon (MPD) client that uses a
Contour ShuttleXpress to control the status of the playback of an MPD
instance.

The program is written to run with Linux.

The Contour ShuttleXpress is the small device in the Contour Shuttle products.
It is a USB device that has five buttons, dial, and a rotation ring.


Why Was This Program Created
----------------------------
I wanted to use my Griffin Powermate MPD client, Powermate-MPD, on a second
Linux system. The Griffin Powermate is no longer being produced. I need to find
a replacement for the Powermate. The ShuttleXpress is what I found as
substitute for the Powermate.

Actions Taken for ShuttleXpress Inputs Events
---------------------------------------------  
- When a button is pushed:
  -- Button 0: Send the Previous command to MPD.  Move backwards in the MPD
               play list. 
  -- Button 1: Send the Play command to MPD.
  -- Button 2: Send the Pause command to MPD.
  -- Button 3: Send the Stop command to MPD.
  -- Button 4: Send the Next command to MPD. Move forward in the MPD play list. 

  The numbering of the buttons is from left to right.

            2
           1 3 
          0   4

          Pause
      Play     Stop
  Prev             Next

- When the dial is rotated the MPD volume is changed:
  -- Rotated Right: The audio volume is increased. 
  -- Rotated Left:  The audio volume is decreased.

- When the ring is rotated random playback is enabled or disabled.
  -- Rotated Right: Random is enabled.
  -- Rotated Left:  Random is disabled.
